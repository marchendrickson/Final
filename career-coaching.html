      <p>A career coach can help you figure out the answers to these questions. I work
        as a strategist in order to help you figure out what your long-term goals and ambitions
        are while providing a framework on how to reach them. I can act as a hands on coach
        keeping you on track, or more hands off and provide with you my experienced opinions,
        experiences, and ideas. Working together we can reach your goals while also providing
        lifelong plans and ideas to keep you on the top of your chosen field.
