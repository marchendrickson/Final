      <p>A career coach can help you figure out the answers to these questions. I work
        as a strategist in order to help you figure out what your long-term goals and ambitions
        are while providing a framework on how to reach them. I can act as a hands on coach
        keeping you on track, or provide with you my experienced opinions, experiences, and ideas.

      <h1>Executive Level Services</h1>
      <p>Executive level positions are limited and searches for the right personal
         and cultural fit require diligence and truthful self identity.  Working with
          a career coach will speed the process when you are ready to make a commitment
           to the work involved. If we mutually agree we are a good fit to work together
            on your job search, we will develop the best package and investment for your
             circumstances.
