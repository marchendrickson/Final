    <p>My career has evolved from a transportation design engineer through the corporate board room to a trainer and coach of engineers searching for ways to make a bigger difference in the world through their careers. I have trained many individuals in the engineering industry in skills necessary to provide outstanding project management, excellent client service, and the ability to develop others.<br/><br/>

I have coached clients, peers, and subordinates to discover the unique value they have to offer the world and ways to offer their value to benefit all.  I have provided coaching for engineers as a partner through their strengths discernment and job searches providing guidance, support, accountability and speed to the process.<br/><br/>

I have served as an Executive Board member of a national engineering firm and Board member of non-profit organizations.  These positions have honed my facilitation and leadership skills and developed my ability to train others to be strong leaders in the engineering industry.</p>
